The dataset contains the expression levels of 71 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear conditioning,
 a task used to assess associative learning. 
 The eight classes of mice are described based on genotype (control or trisomic), 
 behavior (stimulated to learn (context-shock) or not (shock-context)) and treatment (saline or drug memantine). 
 The original experiment aimed to test the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice.
